# Capstone

The motivation for this project is to develop a small-scale lightweight power supply that could eventually be scaled up in size to power the laser for the Army Stryker Vehicle. This power supply will model the actual inputs and outputs of the laser for the Stryker vehicle. This includes looking at the type of drive (current or voltage), the load profile of the laser, acceptable regulation on the output, any output limiters to prevent damage, and types of controllers. Instead of a 50KW laser, we will scale down to a 1 W laser and model our prototype off this. â€‹

The prototype must model the most effective way to power the Stryker laser. The prototype will be based off what type of laser it is (outputs) and the charging availability (inputs). Using the product owner, advisor input, and revised documents, we will provide a prototype to be tested using a lower-scale laser.
