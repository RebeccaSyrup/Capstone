Project Overview: Lightweight Power Supply for a High Intensity Laser. With the rise of electrically powered vehicles and systems, the need for power supplies continues to grow exponentially daily. Furthermore, as technology continues to demonstrate trends toward handheld devices, the need for lightweight power supplies is needed more than ever. Not only does the consumer demand for lightweight power supplies to power their hand-held devices, but they also demand the battery to be long-lasting to promote ease of use. 

High-intensity laser demands large power and requires staying turned on for a certain period. We need a power supply that can sufficiently power the laser for long enough. However, power and duration are inversely proportional. We must take this trade-off into consideration and find the balance between sufficient power and long enough duration. 

Another challenge in the design of power supply is the size and weight. We may not be able to produce a power supply of high power and long duration without causing it to be heavier and larger in size. Therefore, we must carefully obtain information from customers and define each of these properties: power, duration, dimension, and weight.
